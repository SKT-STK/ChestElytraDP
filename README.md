we all want to be able to just combine the elytra with our chestplate - and so thats what i did, but not only that,  
i made it possible to add protection and thorns to an elytra,  
protection has double values cuz without that, it rly wouldnt do much,  
if you wanna go full on out you can craft a gliding chestplate by joining any chestplate as the base item and an elytra as the addition item in the smithing table (as the template use the chestplate's crafting material (for chainmail - iron nugget) (for netherite - a netherite scrap))  
made the Antidote enchantment from DnT mod to not be mutually exclusive with other protection enchantments and made it possible to apply it to the Elytra as well as other chestplates

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
THIS DATAPACK HAS A CORRESPONDING RESOURCEPACK (ChestElytraRP)
