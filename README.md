we all want to be able to just combine the elytra with our chestplate,
however, i think itd be way overpowered,
so i just made it possible to add protection and thorns to said elytra,
protection has double values cuz without that, it rly wouldnt do much,
made the Antidote enchantment from DnT mod to not be mutually exclusive with other protection enchantments and made it possible to apply it to the Elytra as well as other chestplates
